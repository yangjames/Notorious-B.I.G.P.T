that's just listen , don't wanna battle me 
nothin' i don't wanna live no more 
sometimes i hear death knockin' at my front door 
i'm livin' every day like a hustle , another drug to juggle 
another day , another struggle ( uh ) 
i remember sellin' three bricks of weed , blunts and nines 
animals , check it out , i'm thinkin' not to find me 
my crew stay deep throat on bedford in the flip floor 
you want the tongues of a coffin on , the saddle
